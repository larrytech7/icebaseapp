# testapp
This version of the app is pretty much outdated. The latest version of the icebase library needs to be recompiled and imported for the app to be updated.
Recompiling is easy. Just fork the main database project and then clone it to modify and send a pull request.

#USAGE
//TODO

- Import into  your ide using the tools at your disposal or download zip and create new project from it.
- Add icebase library in your gradle app and synchronize. Note that the use of Ecplise for building Android Apps has been discouraged by google and support for eclipse users has probably stopped. Use the new gradle in Android studio to build and run this test app.
- use Log tags to capture debug and error messages.
- 
UI demos coming soon.
